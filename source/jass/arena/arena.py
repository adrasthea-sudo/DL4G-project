    Class for arenas. An arena plays a number of games between two pairs of players. The number of
    games to be played can be specified. What consists of one game depends on the specific arena. The arena keeps
    statistics of the games won by each side and also of the point difference when winning.

    A game consists of at least one round of playing 36 cards.

    The class uses the strategy and template methods patterns. Most common behaviour can be modified by using the
