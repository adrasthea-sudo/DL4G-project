class PlayerRound:
    """
    Class for one round of jass from the players point of view. It contains all the information about the round
    that the player can observe at a specific time in the round. This information is
        - the dealer
        - the player that declared trump,
        - the trump chosen
        - trump was declared forehand (derived information)
        - the tricks that have been played so far
        - the winner and the first player (derived) of each trick

        - the number of points that have been made by the opponent team in this round
        - the number of cards played in the current trick
        - the cards played in the current trick
        - the current player
        - the hand of the current player

    Similar to the class Round, PlayerRound captures
    the information at different stages of the game, like:
        - Player can choose to select a trump or push the right to make trump to his partner
        - Player needs to select trump after his partner pushed
        - Player needs to play a card.
