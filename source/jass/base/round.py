class Round:
    """
    Class for one round (game) of jass. The class contains the complete information about a round when it is either
    in play or complete, including the information of all the hands.

    A 'Round' object captures the information in the following stages of the game:
    - Cards have been dealt, but no trump is selected yet
    - The first player that is allowed to choose trump has passed this right to the partner (optional)
    - Trump has been declared by either player from the team that declares trump, but no card has been played yet
    - Between 1 and 35 cards have been played
    - The last card has been played, which is the end of the round

    In order to make the class slightly more efficient, the array holding the tricks is constructed in the beginning
    and filled.

    The member variables can be set directly or using methods. The methods will ensure the internal
    consistency of the variables, the method assert_invariants can be used during development to verify the
    consistency for the cases when the member variables are set directly.

    This is a base class that allows for implementations of different variants of the game.
